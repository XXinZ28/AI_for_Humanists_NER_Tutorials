This is the NER tutorial I wrote for the AI for Humanists project when I was doing summer school at the University of Washington, Seattle. The tutorial is aimed at humanists who have non-technical backgrounds to perform the NER tasks. The tutorial starts by giving an introduction to NER, followed by two methods of choice: 1) the default method using spaCy pre-trained model, and 2) the newly-released llm-v3, powered by OpenAI, in which an OpenAI API key is needed.
